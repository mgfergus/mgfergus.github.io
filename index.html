                        <p>
                            It started a year and a half ago. It was during my freshman year
                            in college, and I already finished my first semester. I was talking
                            with my cousin over the phone, and he told me about his aspirations
                            to go to Japan and start a business there. I joked with him saying
                            that he should learn the language if he wanted to do that. He then
                            told me that we'll both learn the language together with the thought of
                            traveling to Japan one day. This then sparked an idea in my head. 
                            I should be capable of learning a language, how hard could it be?
                            In retrospect, I realize how naive I was. So there began my language
                            journey. It started with Japanese and now I have taken an interest
                            in Mandarin. I am no where near as good as I would like to be, however
                            I'm hoping with time, that will change.

                        <p>
                            Staying motivated is hard when learning a language. That is why
                            one must make the process fun, as one can easily burn themselves
                            out in the long run.

                            Figuring out what study method best fits me helped me out a lot.
                            While a lot of effort is involved when studying a language, the process
                            becomes a lot smoother when you figure out the right way for you.
