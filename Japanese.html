    <p>
        Japanese has no relation with the Roman alphabet. Because of
        this, Japanese is a difficult, but also a fun language to learn.
        Instead of having one type of script like English, there are three.
        They're called the Katakana, Hiragana, and Kanji. While one can 
        learn the Hiragana and Katakana fully, it is impossible for one
        to learn all of the Kanji as there are over 40,000 characters.
        Of course, one only needs to learn 2,000 characters to be considered
        fluent in Japanese. The Hiragana and Katakana are used to spell out
        the pronunciation of the word. One must know these two before they
        can start learning the Kanji.
